# Stock Porfolio Application

The **Stock Portfolio Application** is a desktop program designed to help users manage and analyze their stock investments.  
It allows users to create and maintain a portfolio, record transactions such as buying and selling, and track the value of their holdings over time.  

Built using **Java with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, this application combines both usability and strong software design.  
In addition to managing stocks, it also provides simple **recommendations** based on stock performance and portfolio trends, making it a practical tool for investment tracking and a great project for reinforcing software engineering concepts.
