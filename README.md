# Stock Portfolio Application

The **Stock Portfolio Application** is a desktop program designed to help users manage and analyze their stock investments.  
It allows users to create and maintain a portfolio, record transactions such as buying and selling, and track the value of their holdings over time.  

Built using **Java with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, this application combines both usability and strong software design.  
In addition to managing stocks, it also provides simple **recommendations** based on stock performance and portfolio trends, making it a practical tool for investment tracking and a great project for reinforcing software engineering concepts.

### What will the application do?
- Allow users to buy, sell, and view stocks in their portfolio.
- Allow users to view their holdings and profit/loss in their portfolio.
- Record buy/sell transactions and maintain a history of investments.
- Filter transactions by action(buy/sell), date and time, or symbol.

### Who will use it?
- Individual investors who want to track their holdings.  
- Students and developers interested in learning OOP and GUI programming with a practical finance-related project.
- Anyone who wants a lightweight tool to simulate and manage a stock portfolio.  

### Why is this project of interest to me?
- This project is valuable because it bridges the gap between **software engineering concepts** and a **real-world application domain**—investing.  
- It provides an opportunity to practice **object-oriented design, GUI development, and data management** while creating a tool that mirrors how real investors track and analyze portfolios.  
- It’s also personally interesting because investing and finance are practical areas where technology directly impacts decision-making and user experience.
